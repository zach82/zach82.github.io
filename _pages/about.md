I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Hohai University, China. I hold a B.Eng. degree from **Southeast University, Nanjing, China**, awarded in 2002, and a Ph.D. degree from the **University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA**, awarded in 2015. My research expertise lies in the fields of Distributed Computing, Reinforcement Learning, and their Applications. I have authored more than 20 papers exploring the application of these technologies in various domains.

My research interests include **Distributed Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and their Applications**.
