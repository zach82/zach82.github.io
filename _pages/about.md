I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Hohai University, China. I hold a B.Eng. degree from **Southeast University, Nanjing, China**, awarded in 2002, and a Ph.D. degree from the **University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA**, awarded in 2015, in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research expertise lies in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Computing, and their Applications. I have authored more than 20 papers and have been granted more than 10 Invention Patents, exploring the application of these technologies in various domains.

My current research interests include **Federated Learning, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, and their Applications**.
