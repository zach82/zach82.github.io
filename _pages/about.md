I am currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Hohai University, China. I hold a B.Eng. degree from **Southeast University, Nanjing, China**, awarded in 2002, and a Ph.D. degree from the **University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA**, completed in 2015. My research expertise lies in the fields of Distributed Computing, Embedded Computing, and their intersection with areas in Machine learning. I have authored more than 20 papers exploring the application of these technologies in various domains.

My research interests include **Distributed/Embedded Computing, Machine Learning and its Applications**, etc.
